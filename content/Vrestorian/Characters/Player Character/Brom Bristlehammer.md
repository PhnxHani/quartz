# Family and Friends:

## Garik Bristlehammer:
First of, my father. He is 357 years old by now, but is still working actively in the silver mine he owns. He is the one that encouraged me to go on my adventures. I know he would rather like it if I stayed home, but he never told me that. I seriously miss his jokes out here in the wilderness!  


## Asabelle Bristlehammer:
Next, my mother. She is celebrating her 363’rd birthday this year. She was always more of a fighter than my father. It was because of her that our family was allowed to keep the rights of the silver mine after Garik found it. She was a very strict mother, but she made me who i am today, and i'm grateful!


## Bafurr Bristlehammer:
My eldest Brother, Bafurr, 152 years old, was always a smart guy. He had a knack for mechanical stuff and spent a lot of time in the library. He began an apprenticeship as an engineer in our city at an early age. Now he is helping me and my family with some pretty cool machines! Lately he joined me on some of my expeditions and he seemed to also have developed an interest in mysteries!

  
## Budrick Bristlehammer:
My middle Brother is the black sheep of the family. He is 127 years old and definitely inherited Mom's fighter nature but only half of her common sense.  
He would constantly cause trouble and blame it on me. After he joined the soldiers he seems to have less excessive energy, and he seems to like it there. He has become a skilled fighter and taught me some things. 


## Urdim Underhand:
My best friend, Urdim, is with his 103 years about my age. I first met him in the library when I was trying to decode the strange writing I found in my family's silver-mine.  He immediately was as curious as me and helped me out a lot. Together we formed the Archaeologist-Guild and explored many places of the world. Without his help, nothing of this would have been possible.  
Additional entry:  
I was wrong, he was only after the money and joined me for his own pocket. I never thought he would betray me like that. I hate you Urdim, I will put a stop to your money hungry schemes! 


# Backstory:
## My life before becoming an explorer:

I grew up in the great halls of [[Valhaven]], a dwarven underground city. I was born as the third child into the Bristlehammer family. My parents Garik & Asabelle Bristlehammer own an active Silver-mine. My oldest brother, Bafurr, has become a skilled engineer in our city and my middle brother, Budrick, joined the guards. I never knew what profession I wanted to assume when I grew up, nothing seemed really interesting and for the time being, I helped out in the mines. That changed when opening another silver-vein revealed something I never saw before. In front of me was a once sealed off structure with statues and inscriptions I have never seen before. Curious about what all of this was, I spent months in the great library trying to decrypt the texts and symbols of what I thought was of an ancient civilization. The legacy of whoever once built this. From that point on I knew that my life was not meant to be spent inside these mines. I want to go out, explore, uncover what is left of the people who lived on this world before we did. Our ancestors.

## An early excavation:

Once again, comrades, I appreciate the honor that you have given me by joining our freshly founded Archeologist Guild! I will uphold the pledge that I took to survey the grandiose kingdoms of the world to the utmost of my abilities.  
  
Thanks to Urdim Underhand for founding the Guild with me and being a great friend. None of this would be possible without you.  
  
In my travels I have already seen many wondrous sites and encountered a fair number of strange creatures. And, to my delight, I have been privileged enough to sample a wide variety of exotic ales brewed by our human neighbors to the south. Ah, comrades, to describe the sweet brew’s would require a whole separate entry.  
  
Well, about the excavation: it was an easy job and only required a small team. A local town accidentally dug up an underground area they didn't know was there. It was full with nasty kobolds that had to be cleared out. Unfortunately, the area wasn't that interesting. I assumed the structures were found to merely be about 100 years old.  
  
Well, I’ve taken enough time already. The road beckons, comrades! I’m off again.

## Thugs!

Greetings, comrades! Be assured that my mission to survey the lands continues unabated. I now write to you from a lonely land called [Location]. I assumed this place would be completely untouched by civilization, but to my surprise I found abandoned farms and countless acres of cropland left for the crows!

I found only a few discarded mementos of the humans who had once lived in this land. But I quickly left that place behind until I came across an abandoned mining town. 

Once again the hairs in my back stood up - as if I was being watched.

The battle practice with my middle brother, Budrick Bristlehammer,  paid off when I grabbed my trusty Warhammer and turned around to look at three shadows leaping down to me from the darkness. With my trained eye, it only took me a moment to realize these were just common thieves. Although my foes were skillful, I dispatched them with relative ease. 

As I left the strange town behind, I was wondering if the thieves were who scared all the people away. With any luck, Ill be able to return here and solve this mystery…

For now i have to continue, my journey is far from over.

## A huge discovery:

Greetings, once again, comrades! Though my previous encounters were hazardous to say the least, they were nothing compared to what I experienced today! 

We moved deeper into the ruins we discovered a few weeks ago. We found a way of opening a caved-in tunnel which had been blocking our progression for far too long.  
We explored countless new rooms and found a lot of artifacts. But suddenly I saw something move from the corner of my eye. I could see that a monster of some reptilian sort moved around… And it was triple my size! But that did not concern me as much as its terrible, glowing eyes that beamed brilliantly like twin stars on a moonless night. I froze in my tracks - realizing that the scaly beast was a basilisk! Multi-legged predators, whose gaping jaws can crush plate armor and have a deadly gaze that turns anyone caught by it to stone!  
Keeping my eyes tightly closed, I slowly reached out into every direction, in the hopes of finding something that I can use to fend the beast off. Having no time to consider my options, I grabbed a stone-carved figurine from one of the nearby tables. I gave it all I had and threw it with all my might at the basilisk - which is when something unexpected happened. The whole place started to shake, pieces of the ceiling started to crash into the ground with huge force. One piece crushed the basilisk and miraculously me, as well as the figurine remained unharmed. On closer inspection it looked like an ornately carved stone statue of a hooded humanoid. But it was more than that… upon holding this figurine I felt a power cursing through my veins that I have not felt before. I was able to move stone & earth simply by concentrating enough!  
  
This was the first time I have found something remotely like this. It proves that something ancient lived here long before us. I have so many unanswered questions! After leaving the tunnels to regroup with everyone else, the ruins collapsed, burrowing everything underneath tons of earth.  
But such a setback should not be the end of Brom Bristlehammer. I will return to this site in due time, solving the mystery about this place.  
  
The road is beckoning comrades! I will write about my next adventure soon!

## A sad day for the Archeologist Guild:

Hello comrades, today I only have a short entry for you. I don't feel like writing right now.  
Our latest job in [Location] led us to some amazing long lost ruins. We were about to wrap the expedition up when my old friend, Urdim Underhand, revealed his true colors. He stole all of our important artifacts and made a run for it. I was about to solve the mystery surrounding this ancient place, but now I'm left with nothing.  
I thought he shared a passion with me, but he conned me into believing that. He was only in for the money…  
  
That might have been my only chance at discovering something that big…  
  
I'm not sure when I will write the next entry, sooo … good luck comrades.

## Curses:

Today, my oldest brother, Bafurr Bristlehammer, joined my Archeologist Guild! He truly is a master of his craft. The machines he builds for us have proven to be extremely helpful in our expeditions. Seems like he has developed a taste for mysteries as well now!  
  
After the latest setback I have something big for today. I heard there was an old underground temple to saronrei in the area. Who knows what we will find there! This is an extremely dangerous expedition as we are heading close to an entrance to the underdark! For this expedition a magical expert called Finntan will join us. We have a lot to prepare so I will update you guys later.  
Never forget: The road beckons, Comrades!  
  

Hey comrades,
Something terrible happened.
We found the underground temple, but it was not directed toward the deity we thought it would.  
Instead we stumbled into one of Lolth’s. I noticed it too late and now Finntan and I received some kind of curse. 

We will head off to find a way to lift this curse, so for the time being I cannot write a lot.

Farewell Comrades, hopefully I won't be gone for too long.            

-Brom
